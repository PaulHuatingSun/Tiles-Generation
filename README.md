## Introduction
This project includes four different tile sets of the geographic phenomena. An index.html file is used to visualize the four tile sets. The map is shown in full screen and the users can switch between the map layers. The title and description gives the users the main theme of the maps.

## Tile Set Layers
#### Tile Set 1: Basemap
![Tile 1](/image/Tile1-Basemap.png "Tile 1") 
- Examined geographic area: Seattle, WA [-122.2559435, 47.6002614] and surrounding area
- Available zoom levels: Min - 1; Max - 10
- Description: This tile set used the basemap called "Monocrome" in the dark mode provided by Mapbox. The basemap is modified with color changes.


#### Tile Set 2: Seattle Landmarks

- Examined geographic area: Seattle, WA [-122.2559435, 47.6002614] and surrounding area
- Available zoom levels: Min - 1; Max - 10
- Description: This tile set is made by using geospatial dataset of point locations for sites, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and street clocks that have been designated as landmarks subject to protection by Seattle ordinance. 


#### Tile Set 3: Base Map and Seattle Landmarks
![Tile 3](/image/Tile3-Layer_Group.png "Tile 3") 
- Examined geographic area: Seattle, WA [-122.2559435, 47.6002614] and surrounding area
- Available zoom layers: Min - 1; Max - 10
- Description: This is a layer group that is composed of a thematic layer from the second tile set and the basemap form the first tile set.


#### Tile Set 4: Black History Month
![Black History Month](/image/Tile4-Black_History_Month.png "Black History Month") 
- Examined geographic area: Seattle, WA [-122.2559435, 47.6002614] and surrounding area
- Available zoom levels: Min - 1; Max - 10
- Description: This is a map layer designed over Mapbox. It embodies a map theme of black history month. The map uses the colors green, red, and yellow to make the users realize this represent the black history month.
